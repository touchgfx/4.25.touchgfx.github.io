This is a graphics entry-level 1.3\u201d round display module based on STM32C091 + 8 MB external flash, running partial framebuffer. The application will have a simple GUI and show how to use the interfaces of the display module (physical controls, ambient light, and UART communication). The MCU platform in the TSD TSS013004A-AD display knob module has the following specifications:","sidebar":"academy"}}}')}}]);
